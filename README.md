## üåü Project Overview

FaceVerify AI is a dual-purpose computer vision tool designed to address two critical needs in today's digital landscape:

1. **Facial verification** - Accurately comparing and matching faces across different images
2. **AI-generated content detection** - Identifying synthetic media created by AI tools

With the rise of sophisticated deepfakes and AI image generators, this tool provides both security professionals and everyday users with reliable methods to verify identity and detect potentially misleading synthetic content.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üë• Face Comparison Capabilities

- **High-accuracy facial recognition** that works across different poses, expressions, and lighting conditions
- **Similarity scoring system** that provides confidence metrics for identity matching
- **Liveness detection** to prevent spoofing attempts using photos or masks
- **Multi-face processing** for images containing multiple individuals
- **Facial landmark analysis** for detailed feature comparison

### ü§ñ AI Content Detection

- **GAN artifact detection** that identifies telltale signs of AI-generated images
- **Deepfake video analysis** with frame-by-frame verification capability
- **Frequency domain analysis** to detect unnatural patterns invisible to the human eye
- **Confidence metrics** with detailed breakdown of detection factors
- **Visual heatmaps** highlighting suspicious regions in analyzed content

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

FaceVerify AI employs state-of-the-art deep learning architectures:

- **Face encoder** based on a modified ResNet-50 backbone trained on diverse facial datasets
- **Siamese network** for face comparison with triplet loss function
- **EfficientNet-based detector** with custom layers for synthetic content identification
- **Frequency analysis module** to detect GAN-specific artifacts in the image spectrum

Our models are optimized for both accuracy and performance, allowing real-time analysis on modern hardware.

## üìä Performance Metrics

| Task | Accuracy | False Positive Rate | False Negative Rate | Processing Speed |
|------|----------|---------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| Face Verification | 98.7% | 0.5% | 1.2% | 15 images/sec |
| AI Detection | 96.3% | 2.1% | 3.4% | 8 images/sec |

*Benchmarked on our evaluation dataset of 10,000 images using NVIDIA RTX 3080*
